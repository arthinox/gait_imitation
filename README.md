# IMITATION LEARNING FOR SIMULATING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL HUMAN LOCOMOTION
# Imitation Learning for Simulating High-Dimensional Human Locomotion
### Author: Ethan Ran

## Overview
This repository contains the most relevant files and scripts I created while working on my senior thesis research project, which aimed to use imitation learning to train an agent to control a high-dimensional musculoskeletal model such that it could walk in a natural-looking manner. Training and simulation were performed using the [DEP-RL](https://deprl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [MyoSuite](https://myosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries, as well as the [MuJoCo physics engine](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html).
